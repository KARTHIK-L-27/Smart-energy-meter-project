## Future Scope

- The system can be upgraded using IoT platforms (ESP8266 / ESP32) for real-time energy monitoring.
- Energy consumption data can be uploaded to cloud servers for analysis and billing purposes.
- A mobile or web application can be developed to view live and historical energy usage.
- The system can be enhanced to calculate power, energy units (kWh), and electricity cost.
- Multiple appliances can be monitored individually using multiple current sensors.
- Integration with smart grid systems for automatic load management is possible.
